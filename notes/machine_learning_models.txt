Machine Learning Models Overview

Linear Regression
- Simplest form of supervised learning
- Predicts continuous values
- Formula: y = mx + b
- Good for understanding relationships between variables
- Assumptions: linear relationship, no multicollinearity

Decision Trees
- Tree-like model of decisions
- Easy to interpret and visualize
- Can handle both classification and regression
- Prone to overfitting
- Random Forest improves upon single trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Finds optimal boundary between classes
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Can use different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF)
- Memory efficient
- Not suitable for large datasets

Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neurons
- Consists of layers: input, hidden, output
- Universal function approximators
- Requires large amounts of data
- Can be deep (many hidden layers)

K-Means Clustering
- Unsupervised learning algorithm
- Groups data into k clusters
- Minimizes within-cluster sum of squares
- Requires choosing number of clusters
- Sensitive to initialization

Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification
- Uses sigmoid function to map to probabilities
- Linear decision boundary
- Provides probability estimates
- Less prone to overfitting than linear regression

Naive Bayes
- Based on Bayes' theorem
- Assumes independence between features
- Fast and simple
- Works well with small datasets
- Good baseline for text classification

Gradient Boosting
- Ensemble method
- Builds models sequentially
- Each model corrects errors of previous ones
- XGBoost and LightGBM are popular implementations
- Often wins machine learning competitions

Model Selection Considerations:
- Size of dataset
- Interpretability requirements
- Computational resources
- Type of problem (classification vs regression)
- Feature types and quality
