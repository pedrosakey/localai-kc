# Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- Designed to perform a narrow task
- Examples: voice assistants, recommendation systems, image recognition
- Currently the most common form of AI

### General AI (Strong AI)
- Hypothetical AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks
- Would match human cognitive abilities
- Does not exist yet

### Superintelligence
- AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects
- Theoretical concept discussed in AI safety research

## Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn without being explicitly programmed.

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: classification, regression
- Common algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, neural networks

### Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in data without labels
- Examples: clustering, dimensionality reduction
- Common algorithms: k-means, PCA, autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Examples: game playing, robotics

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

### Neural Networks
- Inspired by biological neural networks
- Composed of nodes (neurons) and connections (weights)
- Can learn complex patterns in data

### Popular Architectures
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Great for image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Good for sequential data
- **Transformers**: State-of-the-art for natural language processing

## Current Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: ChatGPT, language translation
- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, facial recognition
- **Autonomous Systems**: Self-driving cars, drones
- **Healthcare**: Medical diagnosis, drug discovery
- **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading

## Challenges and Limitations

- **Data Requirements**: Need large amounts of quality data
- **Interpretability**: Difficulty understanding AI decisions
- **Bias**: Can perpetuate or amplify human biases
- **Energy Consumption**: Training large models requires significant compute
- **Safety and Alignment**: Ensuring AI systems behave as intended
